# Open Research Glossary

This glossary is designed to be a resource to inform people about the culture of ‘open research’.

In May 2015, the first version of this Glossary was published on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Open_Research_Glossary/1482094) and hosted by the [Right to Research Coalition](http://www.righttoresearch.org/resources/OpenResearchGlossary/index.shtml) as a community resource. This was originally a crowd-sourced effort, led by Jon Tennant and Ross Mounce.

The rationale was simple. The language underpinning "open research" is complex, touching on a number of issues around copright, licensing, metadata, scholarly publishing, and more. Some of the associated terminology is complex and specialised. This can make participation in discussions around open research difficult.

Now, with the changes in the last 5 years in open research, and increasing community engagement in debates, we feel that an updated version of the Glossary is needed. Our goal with this resource is to make sure that, to the greatest extent possible, participation in discussions is inclusive, rather than divisive.

The latest version of this doccument has been updated by Jon Tennant and Ross Mounce.
