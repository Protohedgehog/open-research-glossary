## OPEN RESEARCH GLOSSARY

This resource based on the original created by [Jon Tennant](https://twitter.com/Protohedgehog/) and [Ross Mounce](https://twitter.com/rmounce).

This glossary is designed to be a resource to inform people about the culture of "research".

This resource was written by the community, and depends on the community to stay current. To update this resource please make changes [here](https://github.com/Protohedgehog/open-research-glossary).


## Core Definitions

- **●●**** Open Access (OA) -** making peer reviewed scholarly manuscripts freely available via the Internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any lawful purpose, without financial, legal or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. May also refer to theses, books, book chapters, monographs and other content. ([BOAI](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/))
- **●●**** Open data -** making data freely available on the public internet permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, pass them to software or use them for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. ([Panton Principles](http://pantonprinciples.org/))
- **●●**** Open Educational Resources (OER) -** high quality, openly licensed, online educational materials for sharing, use, and reuse. They act as a mechanism for instructional innovation as networks of teachers and learners share best practices. ([Source](http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources))
- **●●**** Open Source Software (OSS) -** availability of source code for a piece of software, along with an [pen source license](http://opensource.org/licenses/) permitting reuse, adaptation, and further distribution. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software))
-
**●●**** Article Processing Charge (APC) ****-** a fee charged to the author, creator, or institution to cover the cost of publishing an article, rather than charging the potential reader of the article. APCs may apply to both subscription-based



and Open Access publications. APCs are sometimes charged to authors in order to cover the cost of publishing and disseminating an article in an Open Access scholarly journal. ([Source](http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/glossary/))
- **●●**** Repository (article) -** an archive to deposit manuscripts. These can be personal, institutional, on websites such as [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/) or [edu](http://www.academia.edu/), or subject-based such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/).
- **●●**** Repository (software) -** a collection of files managed with version control software (e.g., bzr, hg, git, csv, svn, etc.). Can be hosted by third-party (e.g., github, bitbucket, sourceforge), by an institution, or self-hosted locally.
-
**●●**** Institutional Repository ****-** An online database designed to collect the intellectual output of a particular institution or university, including digital collections such as electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), pre-prints, or faculty scholarship, and presents associated metadata regarding

the these items. ([Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary#oscp_glossary-page-44))
- **●●**** Embargo period -** a length of time imposed on a research output for users who have not paid for access, or do not have institutional access, before it is made freely available.
- **●●**** Reproducibility -** the similarity between results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods but under different conditions (i.e., pertains to results).
- **●●**** Repeatability -** the similarity between results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods and under identical conditions (i.e., pertains to methods and analysis).
- **●●**** Publishing -** to make a research output available to the public. Commonly refers to the release of works by publishers, irrespective of whether public access is granted or not.
- **●●**** Sharing -** the joint use of a resource or space. A fundamental aspect of collaborative research. As most research is digitally-authored &amp; digitally-published, the resulting digital content is non-rivalrous and can be shared without any loss to the original creator.
- **●●**** Paywall -** restriction via a financial barrier to research, often implemented by legacy publishers. Can be removed by personal or institutional subscription. See Loginwall for a barrier that prevents access, without asking for money to unlock access.
- **●●**** Funder -** an institute, corporation or government body that provides financial assistance for research.
- **●●**** Publisher -** a company whose purpose is to make the outputs of research publicly available.
- **●●**** Creative work -** An original, identifiable piece of content, such as an academic paper, a diagram, a photograph, or a video clip. Owners of creative works have rights, such as copyright, that they might reserve to keep control of the content, or relinquish to allow others to share and reuse that content.
- **●●**** Intellectual property (IP) -** a legal term that refers to creations of the mind. Examples of intellectual property include music, literature, and other artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and phrases, symbols, and designs.
- **●●**** Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) ****-** the rights given to the owners of intellectual property. IPR is protected either automatically (eg copyright, design rights) or by registering or applying for it (eg trademarks, patents). Protecting your intellectual property makes it easier to take legal action against anyone who steals or copies it. IPR can be legally sold, assigned or licenced by the creator to other parties, or joint-owned.
- **●●**** Copyright -** The aspect of Intellectual property that gives creators the right to permit (or not permit) what happens to their creations, as opposed to trademark rights or moral rights.
- **●●**** Copyleft -** a form of licensing that makes a creative work freely available to be modified, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the creative work to be free as well. Open Access does not require works to be copyleft, nor does it necessarily exclude copyleft works from being open access. The recommended licence (CC-BY) for academic publishing is not copyleft.
- **●●**** Subscription -** a form of business model whereby a fee is paid in order to gain access to a product or service - in this case, the outputs of scholarly research.
- **●●**** Toll access -** whereby a fee is required to pass a paywall to access research.
- **●●**** Legacy publisher -** a publisher that historically has operated on a paywall-basedbusiness model.
- **●●**** Open access publisher -** a publisher that publishes all research articles as open access articles. Most legacy publishers have options to make journals at least partially open access.
- **●●**** Open access journal -** a journal that exclusively comprises open access articles.
- **●●**** Impact -** the scale of use of research outputs both inside and outside of academia.
- **●●**** Self-archiving -** making a copy of a manuscript available through a personal website, institutional repository, or other repository.
- **●●**** Scholarly Communication ** ** -** The creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community. The creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community.

- **●●**** Post-print -** a manuscript draft after it has been peer reviewed.
- **●●**** Version of Record (VOR) -** the final version of a manuscript, after peer review and processing by a publisher.
