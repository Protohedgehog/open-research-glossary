## Core Definitions underlying Open Research

* **Citizen Science -**

* **Open Access (OA) -** Making peer reviewed scholarly manuscripts freely available via the Internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any lawful purpose, without financial, legal or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. May also refer to theses, books, book chapters, monographs and other content; [Source](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/).

* **Open Data (OD) -** Making data freely available on the public internet permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, pass them to software or use them for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself; [Source](http://pantonprinciples.org/).

* **Open Educational Resources (OER) -** Making high quality, openly licensed, online educational materials available for sharing, use, and reuse. They act as a mechanism for instructional innovation as networks of teachers and learners share best practices; [Source](http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources).

* **Open Lab Notebooks (OLN) -**  A concept of blogging about research on a regular basis, such that research notes and data are accumulated and published online as soon as they are obtained; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science).

* **Open Materials (OM) -**

* **Open Peer Review (OPR) -**

* **Open Source Software (OSS) -** Availability of source code for a piece of software, along with an [Open Source license](http://opensource.org/licenses/) permitting reuse, adaptation, and further distribution; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).

* **Scholarly Communication -** The creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_communication).


## Scholarly publishing

* **Article Processing Charge (APC) -** A fee charged to the author, creator, or institution to cover the cost of publishing an article, rather than charging the potential reader of the article. APCs may apply to both subscription-based and Open Access publications. APCs are sometimes charged to authors in order to cover the cost of publishing and disseminating an article in an Open Access scholarly journal; [Source](http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/glossary/).

* **Citation -** A reference to a published or unpublished source embedded in content, for the purposes of acknowledging the work and relevance of others to the topic of discussion where the citation appears.

* **Copy editing -** A type of editing designed to improve the formatting, style, and accuracy of text. It usually does not involve changing the content of the original text.

* **Curation -** The selection, preservation, maintenance, collection and archiving of [digital] assets. Curation establishes, maintains, and adds value to repositories of digital data for present and future use; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_curation).

* **Double-dipping -** In the context of OA, double-dipping occurs when a journal has an APC for publishing an author's work, as well as requiring payment (usually through a subscription fee) by the potential user of the work. This model makes the institution or author pay twice to access the work; [Source](http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/glossary/).

* **Embargo period -** A length of time imposed on a research output for users who have not paid for access, or do not have institutional access, before it is made freely available. Typically refers to peer-reviewed versions of manuscripts.

* **Fee waiver -** If an institution, research funder or author cannot pay for an APC, many publishers or journals will offer partial or total waiving for fees; [Source](http://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/3/3/155).

* **Legacy publisher -** A publisher that historically has operated primarily on a paywall-based business model.

* **Library-based publishing -** Many academic libraries are now beginning to act as publishers for scholarly works produced in their institutions and elsewhere.  In some cases, the library works with the university scholarly press to publish works. In other cases, the library publishes works independently or separately from the academic press. Library-based publishers are often strongly in favor of Open Access; [Source](http://www.librarypublishing.org).

* **Loginwall -** A barrier that prevents access by requiring users to register and login to a service, without asking for money to unlock access.

* **Open Access publisher -** A publisher that publishes all research articles as Open Access articles. Most legacy publishers have options to make journals at least partially Open Access (i.e., the 'hybrid' model).

* **Paywall -** Restriction via a financial barrier to access research, often implemented by legacy publishers. Can be removed by personal or institutional subscriptions. 

* **Publisher -** A company whose purpose is to make the outputs of research publicly available, via digital or analogue methods.

* **Publishing -** To make a research output available to the public. Commonly refers to the release of works by publishers, irrespective of whether public access is granted or not.

* **References -** Defines a relationship between one object, a designator, and a second object, a source. Usually takes the form of a bibliography of academic papers at the end of a research manuscript.

* **Repository, general -** An online archive to deposit manuscripts. These can be personal websites, or include platforms such as [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/) or [edu](http://www.academia.edu/).

* **Repository, institutional -** An online database designed to collect the intellectual output of a particular institution or university, including digital collections such as electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), preprints, or faculty scholarship, and presents associated metadata regarding the these items; ([Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary#oscp_glossary-page-44)).

* **Repository, software -** An online collection of files managed with version control software (e.g., bzr, hg, git, csv, svn, etc.). Can be hosted by third-party (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)), by an institution, or self-hosted locally.

* **Repository, subject-based -** A thematic repository based around research disciplines, geographic regions, or languages, such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/).

* **Self-archiving -** Making a copy of a manuscript available through a personal website, institutional repository, or other repository. This often happens in parallel with publication at a journal.

* **Submission fee -** A fee levied by some publishers for submitting a manuscript to their journals.

* **Subscription -** A form of business model whereby a fee is paid in order to gain access to a product or service - in this case, the outputs of scholarly research in journals.

* **Toll access -** A system whereby a fee is required to pass a paywall to access research.

* **Typesetting -** The composition of text by arranging physical pieces of type or by using software to prepare a version of the text suitable for printing. Stored letters and other symbols are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography (conventional spelling system of a language) for visual display.


### Journal or publication Types

* **Book -**

* **Epub -** A free and open [e-book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book) standard by the [International Digital publishing Forum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Digital_Publishing_Forum).

* **Hybrid journal -** Some traditional journals offer an option for authors to make their individual articles freely accessible to anyone worldwide, for an additional fee. All other articles in the journal remain accessible only through subscription; [Source](http://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/hybrid-journals/).

* **Journal -** An aggregation of published research articles, either digital or printed or both. Historically divided into volumes and issues.

* **Megajournal -** A journal with editorial criteria based on scientific soundness instead of a priori estimated newsworthiness or "impact". They typically cover all research disciplines.

* **Monograph -**

* **Open Access journal -** A journal that exclusively comprises Open Access articles.

* **Overlay journals -** An OA journal that does not produce its own content, but selects and curates groups of articles that are already freely available online. An example of this is [Discrete Analysis](https://discreteanalysisjournal.com/); [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal).


### Types of work often made Open Access

* **Accepted author manuscript (AAM) -** The version of a manuscript that has been formally accepted by a publisher for publication.

* **Eprint** - A digital version of a research document available online within a repository.

* **Journal to Wiki publication (J2W) -** Copying text from a published paper to a wiki (such as Wikipedia or Wikibooks), with attribution: legally possible if the licence of the paper is less restrictive than the licence of the wiki.

* **Postprint -** A manuscript draft after it has been peer reviewed.

* **Preprint -** A manuscript draft that has not yet been subject to formal peer review, distributed to receive early feedback on research from peers.

* **Pre-registration-**

* **Registered Reports -** A type of publication in which peer review of the suggested methods and protocol is completed prior to data collection and analysis. Accepted papers then are guaranteed publication in the journal if the authors follow through with the registered methodology; [Source](https://osf.io/8mpji/wiki/home/).

* **Version of Record (VOR) -** The final published version of a manuscript in a journal, after peer review and processing by a publisher.

* **Wiki to Journal publication (W2J) -** Creating a paper on a wiki, using its features for collaboration and informal review, for submission to a journal for formal peer review. Might involve a public wiki such as Wikipedia or Wikiversity, or a specially-created wiki.


### 'Flavours' or 'types' of Open Access

* **Black -**

* **Bronze -**

* **Diamond -** A form of "Gold" OA in which there is no author-facing fee (APC). Sometimes also called 'Platinum' OA.

* **Gold -** Making the final version of manuscript (VOR) freely available immediately upon publication by the publisher.

* **Green -** Making a version of the manuscript freely available in a repository. Often referred to as 'self-archiving', and happens in parallel with publication in a journal.

* **Gratis -** A paper is available to read free-of-charge, though its reuse is still restricted, for example by "All Rights Reserved" or" copyright; [Source](http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/).

* **Libre -** A paper is made available under an open licence, allowing it to be shared and reused, depending on which licence is used; [Source](http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/)). Both 'Libre' and 'Gratis' refer to copyright and licensing restrictions. The difference is often alluded to with the slogan, "Free as in beer, not as in speech."

* **Author addendum -** An author addendum is a supplemental or added agreement to a publishing contract that defines or changes the terms of the contract, often focusing on the transfer of copyright ownership. For authors of scholarly works, an author addendum to a publisher's standard publication contract may be necessary to help ensure that authors protect important rights, such as the right to post their articles online to a personal website or in a digital repository; the right to use their works within a classroom setting; or the right to use their works as the foundation for future research; [Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary).

* **Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) -** A family of UNIX-like operating systems; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).

* **Copyleft -** A form of licensing that makes a creative work freely available to be modified, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the creative work to be free as well. OA does not require works to be copyleft, nor does it necessarily exclude copyleft works from being OA. The recommended licence (CC BY) for academic publishing is not copyleft.

* **Copyright -** The aspect of Intellectual Property that gives creators the right to permit (or not permit) what happens to their creations, as opposed to trademark rights or moral rights.

* **Creative Commons (CC) -** A popular suite of licences that sets out the rights of authors and users, providing alternatives to the standard copyright. CC licences are widely used, simple to state, machine readable and have been created by legal experts.There are a variety of CC licences, each of which use one or more clauses, examples of which are given below. Some licences are compatible with OA in the 'Budapest sense', and some are not; [Source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)).

* **CC Zero (CC 0) -** Waiver of copyright, with no rights reserved. Places content as openly as possible in the public domain; [Source](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0).

* **CC Attribution (CC BY) -** A licence clause that allows the reuse, sharing, and remixing of materials providing the original author is appropriately attributed. Aside from attribution the CC BY licence has no other restrictions on copying or reuse. Compatible with free cultural works.

* **CC NonCommercial (CC NC) -** A licence clause allowing the reuse, sharing, and remixing of materials providing that it is for non-commercial purposes. Not compatible with free cultural works.

* **CC No Derivatives (CC ND) -** A licence clause requiring that derivatives are not made of the original works. Not compatible with free cultural works.

* **CC ShareAlike (CC SA) -** A licence clause requiring that derivative works have the same licence as the original. Compatible with free cultural works.

* **Creative work -** An original, identifiable piece of content, such as an academic paper, a diagram, a photograph, or a video clip.

## Assessment And Metrics

* **Altmetrics -** Altmetrics are "alternative"" ways of recording and measuring the use and impact of scholarship. Rather than solely counting the number of times a work is cited in scholarly literature, alternative metrics also measure and analyze social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogs, wikis, etc.), document downloads, links to publishing and unpublished research, and other uses of research literature, in order to provide a more comprehensive measurement of scholarships reach and impact; [Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary).

* **Bibliometrics -** Bibliometrics is the branch of library and information science concerned with the application of mathematical and statistical analysis to bibliography. Bibliometrics involves the statistical analysis of books, articles, or other publications.

* **H-index -** A personal metric that relates the number of citations to the number of published papers for an academic. It measures the number of papers (n) that have been cited n times; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index).

* **Impact factor -** A numerical measure that indicates the average number of citations to articles published over the previous two years in a journal, and frequently used as a proxy for a journal's relative importance. It is frequently mis-used to evaluate articles and individuals.

* **Journal-level metrics -** Metrics that apply to all papers published within a journal. A common example is the journal Impact Factor.

## Miscellaneous

* **Accessibility -** Refers to the degree of access. Defined by an end-user basis, depending on their ability to understand or reuse content.

* **Content mining -** Large-scale extraction of information from content (e.g., photographs, videos, audio, metadata), usually involving thousands of item; for example using [ContentMine](http://contentmine.org/).

* **Data archiving -** The process of moving data to a storage device for long-term preservation; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_data_archiving).

* **Data mining -** An analytic process designed to explore data in search of consistent patterns and/or systematic relationships between variables, and then to transform this information into content for future use.

* **Funder -** An institute, corporation or government body that provides financial assistance for research.

* **Impact -** The scale of use of research outputs both inside and outside of academia.

* **Mandate -** An authority to carry out a policy. In this context, largely to conform to OA policies.

* **Open Access Movement (OAM) -** A global movement started in the late 1990s and early 2000s fueled by the widespread public access to the World Wide Web. Its prime objective is the free and unrestricted access and reuse of the world's knowledge.

* **Open Access Directory Events -** Conferences and workshop archive related to OA; [Source](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Events).

* **Openwashing -** Having an appearance of OSS and open-licensing for marketing purposes, while continuing proprietary practices. Coined by [Audrey Watters](https://twitter.com/audreywatters).

* **Publicly funded research -** Refers to research which is, at least in part, funded by Governments, often through Research Councils.

* **Repeatability -** The similarity between results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods and under identical conditions (i.e., pertains to methods and analysis).

* **Reproducibility -** The similarity between results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods but under different conditions (i.e., pertains to results).

* **Reproducibility, computational -** When publishing computational findings, include details and access to the underlying code, data, and implementation.
